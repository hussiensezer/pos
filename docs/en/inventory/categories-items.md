# Raw Materials — Category Tree

## 👀 Screen Overview
The **Raw Materials** screen in the system enables you to organize raw materials in a **hierarchical category tree** structure.  
The idea here is that raw materials are not just a simple list, but are distributed across levels to make them easier to manage and track.

The table displays:
- **#**: Identification number for each group.  
- **Name**: Group name.  
- **Creation Date**.  
- **Parent Group**: Parent category.  
- **Level**: Whether it's first, second, or third level.  
- **Status**: Active or inactive.  
- **Image**: Image or illustrative icon.  
- **Control**: Edit the group.

At the top there is:
- **Add New Raw Material Group** button.  
- Search/filter tools.  
- Option to specify **number of rows**.  
- Ability to **export data** to PDF or Excel.

## 🧭 When to Use Raw Materials?
### ✅ Case 1: Production or Preparation Activity
- Factories, central kitchens, restaurants, workshops…  
- Here you need to build a raw materials tree because they go into **recipes (BOM)** or are converted to final products.  

### ❌ Case 2: Direct Sale of Final Products
- Supermarkets, grocery stores, cafes…  
- In this case, **you don't need raw materials**, because you're selling ready-made final products (like Pepsi, mineral water, packaged juices).  
- You can simply add these products directly in the **Final Products** section.

## 🧱 Understanding Levels
- **Level 1:** General category (example: Frozen foods, Fabrics, Juices).  
- **Level 2:** Finer divisions within the category (example: Frozen meats, Cotton, Fruits).  
- **Level 3:** Very detailed specifications (example: Burger, Egyptian cotton, Mango).  

> It's preferable not to exceed 3 levels to keep management clear and easy.

## 🛠️ Practical Steps to Build the Tree
1. Create **Level 1** for major categories (frozen foods, meats, vegetables...).  
2. Add **Level 2** for internal divisions (meats, fish, cheese...).  
3. Add **Level 3** when you need more detail (chicken, burger, liver...).  
4. Upload an appropriate image or icon for each group.  
5. Set the status (active/inactive).  
6. Repeat according to your needs—then link them later with recipes, movements, or reports.

## ⚠️ Important Tips and Best Practices

### ✅ Do This
- **Start Simple**: Begin with only 2-3 levels, expand over time
- **Use Clear Names**: Avoid abbreviations, use understandable names
- **Maintain Consistency**: Use the same naming pattern across all levels
- **Review Regularly**: Modify the tree every 3-6 months based on developments
- **Document Changes**: Write notes about the reason for each modification

### ❌ Avoid This
- **Don't Increase Levels**: Avoid reaching Level 4 or 5
- **Don't Mix Types**: Don't put "meats" under "vegetables"
- **Don't Forget Images**: Images help with quick identification
- **Don't Neglect Status**: Make sure to activate/deactivate groups

## 🔧 Solving Common Problems

### Problem: "I don't know where to start"
**Solution**: Start with one simple category (like "Frozen Foods") and build gradually

### Problem: "Too many groups and I can't control them"
**Solution**: Use search and filtering, and export data for review

### Problem: "I forgot to add an image to a group"
**Solution**: You can edit the group at any time and add the image

### Problem: "I want to rearrange the levels"
**Solution**: Use the "Parent Group" feature to reorganize
