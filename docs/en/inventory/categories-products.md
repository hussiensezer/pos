# Product Categories — Classification Tree

## 👀 Screen Overview

The **Product Categories** screen in the system enables you to organize final products in a **hierarchical classification tree** structure.  
The idea here is that products are not just a simple list, but are distributed across levels (Levels) to make them easier to manage, track, and sell.

The table displays:
- **#**: Identification number for each group.  
- **Name**: Group name.  
- **Creation Date**.  
- **Parent Group**: Parent category.  
- **Level**: Whether it's first, second, or third level.  
- **Image**: Image or illustrative icon.  
- **Status**: Active or inactive.

At the top there is:
- **Add New Product Group** button.  
- Search/filter tools.  
- Option to specify **number of rows**.  
- Ability to **export data** to PDF or Excel.

## 🧭 When to Use Product Categories?

### ✅ Case 1: Direct Sale of Final Products
- Supermarkets, grocery stores, cafes, restaurants…  
- Here you need to build a product tree because you're selling ready-made final products for consumption.

### ✅ Case 2: Production Activity with Final Products
- Factories, central kitchens, workshops…  
- Here you need product categories to manage the final products you produce.

## 🧱 Understanding Levels

- **Level 1:** General category (example: Electronics, Food, Clothing).  
- **Level 2:** Finer divisions within the category (example: Mobile phones, Beverages, Shoes).  
- **Level 3:** Very detailed specifications (example: Android phones, Carbonated drinks, Sports shoes).  

> It's preferable not to exceed 3 levels to keep management clear and easy.

## 🛠️ Practical Steps to Build the Tree

1. Create **Level 1** for major categories (electronics, food, clothing...).  
2. Add **Level 2** for internal divisions (phones, beverages, shoes...).  
3. Add **Level 3** when you need more detail (Android, carbonated, sports...).  
4. Upload an appropriate image or icon for each group.  
5. Set the status (active/inactive).  
6. Repeat according to your needs—then link them later with products, sales, or reports.
